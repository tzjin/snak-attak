<h4>Pitch: </h4>
  
My good friend Kevin, like much of Princeton’s campus, loves good food and will go anywhere for it. Forbes often has delicious Asian food, and one day for dinner, Kevin was making the trek down from the E-Quad to Forbes for their Udon noodles. After he got to Forbes, he texted me that he was devastated--there were no noodles. 

This highlights the problems with campus dining. 1. The user interface for menu or nutrition is difficult to use and takes at least three clicks from any university website 2. It’s impossible to compare dining options at different dining halls without opening up several windows or filter food for dietary restrictions. 3. The food in the dining hall is not always consistent with what’s online. 4. There’s no way of knowing whether the food will be good or bad. 

We’re developing SnikSnak so that we can help each other find the best food on campus and have created a clean, easy-to-use interface to streamline information. Look for us in online at sniksnak.herokuapp.com and coming soon to the app stores for Android and iOS. 

We allow you to filter your food options by meal, dining hall location, and dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, pork-free, nut-free), and vote to help others know which foods are good that day.
